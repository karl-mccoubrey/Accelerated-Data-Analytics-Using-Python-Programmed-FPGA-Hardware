# Accelerated-Data-Analytics-Using-Python-Programmed-FPGA-Hardware
Implementation of FPGA hardware acceleration using new (2018) Xilinx PYNQ-Z2 architecture. Acceleration conducted over unsupervised K-Means clustering algorithms. Base recordings taken over Python OpenCV K-Means clustering, as well as variations in formatting. Accelerated algorithm produced in C before being implemented on FPGA programmable logic, whilst being conducted via the Python interface.
