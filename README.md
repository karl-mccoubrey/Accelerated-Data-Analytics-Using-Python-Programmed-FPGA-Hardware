# Accelerated-Data-Analytics-Using-Python-Programmed-FPGA-Hardware
Implementation of FPGA hardware acceleration using new (2018) Xilinx PYNQ-Z2 architecture. Accelerating data analytics of image processing using unsupervised K-Means clustering algorithms. Base image processing implemented in Python OpenCV K-Means clustering, including variations to function formats. Accelerated algorithm produced in C before being implemented to FPGA programmable logic. Control and interaction with the FPGA architecture conducted via the Python interface.
